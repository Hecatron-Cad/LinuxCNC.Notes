# Hecatronic LinuxCNC Notes

This is just a collection of LinuxCNC Notes I've put together for installing LinuxCNC onto a RPi4.  
The goal is to document how to install and get the best latency values I can.  
As well as document setting up some configurations for some devices I'm working on.

I'm currently using DietPi at the moment, but I may also try Armbian

::list{type="success"}
  - It's basically raspian if used with a rpi
  - It's similar to dietpi in that anything not needed is left out by default
  - It has a set of helper utils for automatically setting up remote desktop / xfce etc
