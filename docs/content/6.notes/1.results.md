## RPI3

I think a 64bit image created for the RPI4 should work on the RPI3.  
However, when trying the latest 6.3 kernel I compiled it just bombed on bootup.  
So this is something I'll need to check at a later point in time.  

## Hard Disk

So far I've tried with and without the USB Hard disk but with no difference in results.  
I think it's safe to boot from a USB Hard disk, at least with the RPI4.


## TODO

  * re-write the latency test script in python
  * test without glxgears / xorg at the cli 

  * generation of image
