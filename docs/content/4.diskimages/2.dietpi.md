## Setup

### Password Change

The first thing you may want to do is change the default password.  
For the dietpi and root users the default is `dietpi` for the password

```sh
# Change the logged on dietpi password
passwd
# Change the root password
sudo passwd
```

### WIFI

Next is WIFI, when first booting up it may take a couple of minutes to boot.  
This is due to WIFI already being enabled but there is no SSID configured.  

```sh
# Open Up the dietpi config menu
sudo dietpi-config
# Select Network Options: Adapters
# Select Wifi
# Select Scan
# Then pick which wifi SSID to connect to long with the WPA Password.
# Select Back / Apply
```

After setting up the WIFI it's best to do a reboot.  
This will allow the NTP service to run and select the correct date / time.

### Linux Kernel Versions

To select which kernel version to use, edit the `/boot/config.txt file`

This is the default, it selects the 6.3 relatime kernel
```sh
os_prefix=/rt-6.3/
#os_prefix=/rt-6.4/
```

This selects a 6.4.0-rc2 realtime kernel
```sh
#os_prefix=/rt-6.3/
os_prefix=/rt-6.4/
```

This defaults to the non realtime raspian kernel 6.1.21-v8+
```sh
#os_prefix=/rt-6.3/
#os_prefix=/rt-6.4/
```
