# Other Devices

There are many alternatives to the RPI now, especially since getting hold of one has become quite difficult recently.  
Most of these alternatives (although not all) seems to be based around the Rockchip RK3588S chipset.

It does look as if the 6.3 Kernel has incorporated support for many alternatives recently including the Rockwell chipset.

For alternative devices Armbian may also be worth investigating as it looks as if they have custom patches setup for different devices. However, just building the kernel on it's own isn't easy without building all of Armbian, unless the patches could just be extracted out and run against 6.3

## Orange Pi 5

The Orange Pi 5 uses the Rockchip RK3588S  
For the official sources 5.4.65 seems to be the latest version available, although 6.3 may be a workaround to that now.

The Orange PI5 itself doesn't have inbuilt WIFI, although it does have a slot for a wifi card / SSD Disk.  
I'm not sure how much device support is incorporated into the latest kernel.  
Some work may be required to document and figure out all the configuration items to be used.

## ODroid

There's some suggestion here that using the ODroid works ok for LinuxCNC
