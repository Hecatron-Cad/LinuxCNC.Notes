# Other Forms of Benchmarking

There are some other forms of benchmarking which I've not got around to testing yet.

## Stress Testing

  * There's rt-tests which contains cyclictest  
    https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/documentation/howto/tools/rt-tests
  * There's also stress-ng / stress  
    https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eng2.12114

```sh
apt install rt-tests stress-ng stress
```

## Realtime Tracing

To identify which part of the kernel is causing the most amount of latency
