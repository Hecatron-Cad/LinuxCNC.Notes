# LinuxCNC Benchmarking

In order to benchmark the current latency we can use some of the tools bundled with linuxcnc

## Latency Test

The first method is to just run latency-test and make a note of the maximum jitter value
```sh
latency-test
```

  ::card
  #title
  Jitter

## Latency Histogram

One method is to run a latency histogram.  
There's a couple of buttons here for launching glxgears and taking a screenshot.  
Try opening around 5 x glxgears, then running the graph for a while.

```sh
latency-histogram --nobase --sbinsize 1000 --show
```

  With 5x glxgears.
