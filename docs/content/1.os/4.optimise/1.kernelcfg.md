# Kernel Config

## Realtime Pre-emption model

This is the main switch to enable a realtime kernel when using the realtime patches

  * CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT  
    General -> Preemption Model -> Select full real time

## Debian Realtime

Looking at the Debian realtime options the below appears to be set for the realtime kernel

  * https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/blob/master/debian/config/arm64/rt/config
  * https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/blob/master/debian/config/featureset-rt/config

KVM appears to be disabled, it doesn't seem to make a difference for the newer kernels.  
I think originally it was required for realtime to work on some platforms.  
By having it disabled I think HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK is then enabled which then allows for ARCH_SUPPORTS_RT on some platforms, although I don't think it's mandatory on aarch64.

  * CONFIG_KVM disabled

The enabling of the tracer options should in theory allow for gathering information as to where latency issues might be present so might be useful at a later point.

  * CONFIG_RCU_EXPERT enabled
  * CONFIG_SCHED_TRACER already enabled
  * CONFIG_HWLAT_TRACER enabled
  * CONFIG_OSNOISE_TRACER enabled
  * CONFIG_TIMERLAT_TRACER enabled

This doesn't have an impact on latency but could be interesting for latency tests possibly.  
This is something I've enabled

  * CONFIG_HIST_TRIGGERS
