# Userspace Config

## Video Acceleration

This one is very important and has the biggest impact by far on a RPI4.  
This enables the video acceleration for the display.
```sh
# Within /boot/config.txt
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
```

## Turbo Boost

It's possible to get some additional performance with some overlocking.  
So far I've mostly avoided that to avoid over heating the RPI, although I have enabled.
```sh
# Within /boot/config.txt
force_turbo=1
```

## Disable Audio

Make sure to disable audio within /boot/config.txt
```sh
# Within /boot/config.txt
dtparam=audio=off
```

Next launch `dietpi-config`  
Under Audio Options select the option to disable the Audio completely

## Display Overscan

I don't believe this has any impact on latency.  
But if you're display has a black border, then setting this to 1 can get rid of that.  
If the screen is flickering try setting it to 0

```sh
# Within /boot/config.txt
disable_overscan=1
```

## Scaling Govenor

Using `dietpi-config`

  * Go to Performance Options
  * Select CPU Govenor
  * Select Performance

The default is `schedutil` the current setting can also be seen via
```sh
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

## Disable Swap

One thing to make sure of is to make sure any swap partitions are disabled  
To make this persistent comment out the swap line within `/etc/fstab`
```sh
# List the swap partitions that are setup
cat /proc/swaps

# Switch off all swaps
swapoff -a
```
