# Kernel Config

Below are kernel configuration settings I've tried but didn't seem to have much affect.  
I suspect some of them may be geared more towards different platforms such as intel.

## Sceduling

There was some suggestion of adding these in.  
Although I think the differences are negligible / difficult to detect.  
I'm avoiding these settings for now.

  * CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
  * CONFIG_SCHED_CORE

## CB / HZ Settings

  * CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL
  * CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU

Both of these options allow us to use the options at the boot command line of `nohz_full` and `rcu_nocbs`  
I couldn't see any improvement with these settings if anything possibly making things worse.  
I'm avoiding these settings for now, I suspect they may work better on a full intel PC.
