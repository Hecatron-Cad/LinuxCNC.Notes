# Boot Options

Below are kernel boot settings I've tried but didn't seem to have much affect.  
I suspect some of them may be geared more towards different platforms such as intel.

## No Difference / Makes things Worse

These are some of the settings that seem to be suggested but didn't seem to make any observable difference.  
At least for a RPI4.

  * `idle=poll`
  * `audit=0` Disable audit messages in dmesg
  * `mitigations=off` This disables certain security mitigations added to the kernel
  * `plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles` Don't issue a bootsplash on any serial console
  * `rcu_nocbs=2,3` no difference
  * `nohz_full=2,3` makes things worse I think

This option was used on the original linuxcnc image
But it's not related to latency, instead it was to fix a USB issue with the older 5.4 kernels at the time

  * `total_mem=3072` 

## Scheduler

Historically one option to set would have been `elevator=deadline`.  
However, this is now depreciated in more recent kernels.  
The kernel will now automatically set a scheduler based on each device.  
I suspect this is a setting we can leave alone for the newer kernels.

To see which ones are available for the sda device for example
```sh
cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
# Typically reports back
# none [mq-deadline] kyber bfq
```
