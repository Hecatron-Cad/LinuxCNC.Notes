# Armbian Notes

## Supported Version

The supported version of Arbmian for the RPI4 appears to be based on Ubuntu instead of Raspian

  * https://www.armbian.com/rpi4b/
  * Armbian 23.02 Jammy
  * Ubuntu 22.04.02 LTS

The debian version it's based on appears to be bookworm (which is what we want)

  * https://askubuntu.com/questions/445487/what-debian-version-are-the-different-ubuntu-versions-based-on

```sh
cat /etc/debian_version
```

## Unsupported Version

There's also some unsupported versions here

  * https://github.com/armbian/community
  * Armbian 23.05.0-trunk Lunar

This uses Ubuntu lunar or bookworm based on the hardware
For the RPI4 this is Lunar or Ubuntu 23.04


## Enable Kernel Updates

There is a menu option to switch kernels here
```sh
armbian-config
# Select System -> Defreeze
# Select System -> Other
```

However, selecting a different kernel here just seemed to delete the kernel image / make the system unbootable  
The most recent kernel for supported is 6.1.11

## Overclocking

It looks like by default it's doing a bit of overlclocking
```
over_voltage=2
arm_freq=1800
```

## Building Image

  * https://github.com/armbian/build

```sh
apt install git
git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```
The free disk space check seems borked with a usb hard disk mounted
